# Time-Series-Analysis-of-NAICS
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) represents a continuing cooperative effort among
Statistics Canada, Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI), and the Economic Classification
Policy Committee (ECPC) of the United States, acting on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget, to create
and maintain a common industry classification system. With its inception in 1997, NAICS replaced the existing
classification of each country, the Standard Industrial Classification (1980) of Canada, the Mexican Classification of
Activities and Products (1994), and the Standard Industrial Classification (1987) of the United States. Since 1997,
the countries have collaborated in producing 5-year revisions to NAICS in order to keep the classification system
current with changes in economic activities. The NAICS changes for 2017 represent a minor revision and all occur
within sector boundaries.
